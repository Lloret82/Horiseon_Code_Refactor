# Horiseon website code refactor
## Description
### The client requested a code refactor for the Horiseon website homepage. The main reason of this refactoring is to make the previous code more accessible. The mod does not change the styling of the page.

## What has been done
* Classes in style.css were consolidated
* HTML elements replaced with semantic HTML
* "alt" text added to images
* Comments provide in both HTML and CSS file with explanation
* Fixed a broken link in the header menu
* Changed the title that was too generic "website"
